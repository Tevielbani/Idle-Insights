# Idle-Insights
This is the Code for my game 'Idle Insights'
In this Game you play as a young person who has just inherited a House from their Eccentric Grandfather
You move into the House due to a lack of other accommodations and find an old Tome in the attic
you decide to translate the tome with the scraps of notes you find with it, and slowly gain inhuman knowledge and insight
eventually you will be able to find and join a cult, and through them buy new furnishings for your home
as you rank up in the cult you will translate more and more Tomes, faster and faster, until you ascend beyond human
as a Lesser God you will rank up in the court of any God you choose, until you become their right hand
then you will have to reset and begin again, only with some memory of the court and an appropriate court
you will repeat this process until you have become the right hand of every God at least 5 times
